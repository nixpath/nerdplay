YouTube audio player based on Node.JS and Python.
Tested on Orange Pi Zero. 

How it works:
1. You run Node.JS program on the host.
2. Connect to the host:
   Write IP of host in browser of client
At the website:
   Write the name of video that contains audio you need.
   When you write the name of video Node.JS sends the string to a Python program.
   Python program gets it and makes query in YouTube. 
   Then it plays the song.
